	<h4 style="background-color:lightgray;">Combining terms: Boolean operators: and, or, not</h4>
	<p>
		Use <b>or</b> to broaden your search.
		Example: search words in title for "hardware <b>or</b> software" to find all records containing the word "hardware" as well as all the records containing the word "software" in the title
	</p>
	<p>
		Use <b>and</b> to limit your search.
		Example: search words in title for "hardware <b>and</b> software" to find all records containing BOTH the word "hardware" and the word "software" in the title.
	</p>
	<p>
		Use <b>not</b> to narrow your search.
		Example: search words in title for "hardware <b>not</b> software" to find all records containing the word "hardware" but not if they also include the word "software" in the title. Be careful, you may eliminate records containing the term "hardware" that are of value to your research!
